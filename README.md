Mammal Milk API ü•õ

A RESTful API built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, providing CRUD operations on mammal milk data stored in a MySQL database.

This project was designed as a demonstration of a simple Python web API, focusing on clean architecture, database interaction, and maintainable code.
(The ‚Äúmammal milk‚Äù theme started as a lighthearted joke among friends, but the implementation itself is fully professional.)

üìå Overview

Framework: Flask with Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests

Database: MySQL (via PHPMyAdmin)

ORM: SQLAlchemy

Connector: mysql-connector-python

Language: Python 3.x

The project demonstrates:

Setting up a Python REST API with Flask

Using SQLAlchemy sessions with stored procedures

Following a modular service-based architecture

Writing clear documentation and logging for debugging

üöÄ Features

Retrieve all records (GET)

Insert new records via stored procedures (POST)

Update existing records (PUT)

Delete records (DELETE)

CORS support for integration with frontend applications

Logging configured at DEBUG level for development

‚ö° Getting Started
‚úÖ Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

MySQL installed locally (with PHPMyAdmin for easier management)

Database: mammalmilkdb

Example SQL setup:
```sql
CREATE TABLE mammal_milk (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  mammal VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  milk_quantity FLOAT NOT NULL
);

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE AddMilkRecord(IN p_mammal VARCHAR(50), IN p_milk_quantity FLOAT)
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO mammal_milk(mammal, milk_quantity) VALUES (p_mammal, p_milk_quantity);
END$$

CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateMilkRecord(IN p_id INT, IN p_mammal VARCHAR(50), IN p_milk_quantity FLOAT)
BEGIN
  UPDATE mammal_milk SET mammal = p_mammal, milk_quantity = p_milk_quantity WHERE id = p_id;
END$$

CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteMilkRecord(IN p_id INT)
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM mammal_milk WHERE id = p_id;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
